    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast</li>
      <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/2 tbsp cooking oil</li>
      <li>1 x 16 oz. jar salsa</li>
      <li>1 x 15 oz. can black beans</li>
      <li>1/2 cup frozen sweetcorn kernels</li>
      <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>2 oz. queso fresco or feta</li>
      <li>1 handful fresh coriander</li>
      <li>2 sliced spring onions</li>
      <li>4 cups cooked rice for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel. Place the chicken on a cutting board and cover it with a piece of plastic wrap. Use a mallet or rolling pin to gently pound the chicken to an even thickness (about 1/2-inch thick). This step is very important to make sure the chicken cooks quickly and evenly, without drying out.</li>
      <li>Combine the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, and salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle the spices over both sides of the chicken, and then rub it over the surface to make sure it&lsquo;s evenly coated.</li>
      <li>Heat a large deep skillet over medium heat. Add the cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface. Once the skillet is very hot, add the chicken and cook on both sides until browned and cooked through (about 5 minutes each side. Cooking time will vary with the size of your chicken pieces and type of cookware).</li>
      <li>While the chicken is cooking, rinse and drain the black beans. Roughly chop the cilantro or slice the green onions, depending on which you prefer to use.</li>
      <li>Transfer the cooked chicken to a clean cutting board and let it rest while you prepare the creamy salsa. Turn the burner down to medium low. Pour the salsa into the skillet and stir to dissolve the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Add the black beans and frozen corn kernels and allow the sauce to heat through.</li>
      <li>To prevent the sour cream from curdling when added to the salsa, first add a few spoonfuls, one at a time, to the sour cream to slowly increase its temperature and acidity. Once the sour cream is slightly warm, add it back to the rest of the salsa in the skillet and stir to combine. Turn the heat off.</li>
      <li>Slice the chicken breast into strips, then place it on top of the creamy salsa sauce in the skillet. Top the skillet with crumbled cheese and cilantro or green onion. Serve over a bed of cooked rice.</li>
    </ol>
