    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These sweet, spicy corn cakes are flavored with curry paste and makrut lime.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cans of sweetcorn</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Thai red curry paste</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>3/4 cup cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tbsp salt</li>
      <li>3 makrut lime leaves or 1/4 cup Thai basil leaves (optional, but tasty)</li>
      <li>1 litre vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>Store-bought or homemade Thai sweet chilli sauce for dipping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove corn kernels from cobs. Heat oil to 300°F (149°C) in a wok or Dutch oven. Line a large platter or cookie sheet with paper towel and keep it nearby.</li>
      <li>Reserve half of corn kernels and place the other half in the blender or food processor along with red curry paste, egg, rice flour, baking powder, and salt; blend until smooth and transfer mixture to a bowl.</li>
      <li>Stack up makrut lime leaves (or basil leaves) and roll them up tightly into a roll. Slice the roll crosswise as finely as possible. Fold makrut lime leaf strips into corn batter along with reserved whole corn kernels.</li>
      <li>Drop corn batter very gently into oil by the tablespoon. Do not over-fill pot. Once the fritters float to the top, flip them around to make sure they're browned evenly. Once they're golden brown and start to darken around the edges, fish them out onto the paper towel-lined platter with a slotted spoon. Repeat until all fritters are cooked.</li>
      <li>Allow fritters to cool slightly. Serve them with Thai sweet chili sauce.</li>
    </ol>
