    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I include a recipe for this well-known dish because most people I know get it completely wrong, either adding milk or cream or letting the eggs become scrambled. This recipe is the real thing. It was brought to Lazio from Umbria by coal men (carbonari), who came to sell charcoal to the Romans. Since then it has been adopted by the Romans and is famous worldwide.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>220g Spaghetti or Spaghettoni</li>
      <li>25g Guanciale (cheek of pork) or pancetta (Italian bacon) cut into small cubes</li>
      <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>50g Parmesan cheese (or aged pecorino) freshly grated</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook pasta in large pan of boiling water until al dente.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in pan and fry the guanciale or pancetta until crisp.</li>
      <li>Lightly beat the eggs in a large bowl with the grated cheese and pepper.</li>
      <li>When the pasta is ready, drain and add to the pan with the guanciale. Mix well to coat everything.</li>
      <li>Take off the heat. Allow to cool slightly.</li>
      <li>Add the egg and cheese mixture. Stir to coat pasta and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
